# UiPath RPA User Acceptance Testing Project

## Overview
This project aims to automate the User Acceptance Testing (UAT) process for a web application using UiPath Robotic Process Automation (RPA). The web application under testing is [provide the web application URL here]. The goal is to streamline the testing process, reduce manual effort, and ensure that the web application performs as expected.

## Prerequisites
- A UiPath Automation Cloud account.
- UiPath Studio Community Edition installed on your computer.
- Access to the web application for testing ([web application URL](https://cmpg323-ecopowerlogistics.azurewebsites.net/)).
- UserName - joeyparadise61@gmail.com
- Credentials - @Unclep61

## Project Structure
- **GitHub Repository:** [Link to the GitHub repository](https://github.com/yourusername/CMPG-323-Project-4)
- **UiPath Process:** 'Connected Office Web Application – User Acceptance Testing'

## How to Use the UiPath RPA Test Automation
Follow these steps to use the UiPath RPA automation for UAT:

1. Clone the GitHub repository to your local machine.
2. Install UiPath Studio Community Edition if not already installed.
3. Open UiPath Studio and load the 'Connected Office Web Application – User Acceptance Testing' process.
4. Prepare the Excel test data file with input data and desired output data.
5. Run the UiPath process to automate the UAT tasks.

## Recording Results
After running the UiPath process, the results will be recorded in the data table. Records will indicate whether the test cases passed or failed. The test results will also be updated in the Excel spreadsheet under the 'Test Results' column (TRUE for pass, FALSE for fail).

## Project Documentation
This section explains how stakeholders can use the report generated by this UiPath RPA User Acceptance Testing project.

### 1. Accessing the Report

- To access the report, navigate to the 'Reports' folder in the GitHub repository.
- You will find the report file named 'UAT_Report_MMDDYYYY.pdf' (replace MMDDYYYY with the actual date of the report generation).

### 2. Opening the Report

- Download the report file to your local machine.
- Use a PDF reader such as Adobe Acrobat Reader or any PDF-compatible software to open the report.

### 3. Navigating the Report

- The report is organized into sections for ease of navigation.
- Use the table of contents to jump to specific sections of interest.

### 4. Understanding the Report

The report provides a comprehensive overview of the User Acceptance Testing results, including:

- **Summary**: A high-level summary of the testing process and results.
- **Test Cases**: Details of each test case, including input data, expected output, and actual results.
- **Pass/Fail Status**: Indicates whether each test case passed or failed.
- **Test Results**: Detailed logs and screenshots for failed test cases.
- **Recommendations**: Suggestions for action based on the test results.

### 5. Using the Test Results

- Review the 'Pass/Fail Status' section to identify test cases that may have failed.
- For any test cases marked as 'Fail,' review the 'Test Results' section to understand the issues encountered during testing.
- Utilize the 'Recommendations' section to take appropriate actions to address test failures.

### 6. Reporting Issues

- If you encounter any issues or discrepancies in the report, please report them to the project owner (contact details provided in the README).
